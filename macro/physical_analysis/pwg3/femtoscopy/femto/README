MpdFemto package: general description and some useful tips on how to ...

1. General info
This release is considered as the first stable one to be used for production.
It includes almost all suggestions proposed by the maintainer.
The package can operate in two modes. The first one allows one to work with any Monte-Carlo input written in the corresponding format (see below).
The second one assumes its use when doing femtoscopy with dst. Right now it does not work, since the first step of the package checking use is Monte-Carlo.
The package program codes are located in the physics/femto directory. They are separated by three directories. Source codes in the MpdFemtoMaker and fsiTools directories 
are not supposed to be edited by users. They establish a frame of the femto package. 
User classes to be added to the project should be located in the MpdFemtoMakerUser directory.

2. Data formats we use
Input for the package must be prepared in the McDst-format (if working with Monte-Carlo) or the MpdMiniDst-format when processing dst-files with reconstructed data.
All necessary program codes to be used for it are implemented in the MpdRoot software. To get more information on it, please look at 
the mpddst/mcDst and mpddst/MpdMiniEvent directories. The codes for all the formats we use are in the most recent actual state being updated to the latest versions available.
A small routine that does convertion from the vHLLE+UrQMD model to the format is called createMcDstFromVHLLE.C("input", "output") in the  macro/physical_analysis/mcDst directory.

3. Data storage to be used for production
Right now we have mcDst-data for the UrQMD and vHLLE+UrQMD simulations already performed at the NICA energies.
The data can be found at the HYBRILIT / GOVORUN supercomputer in the following directories:

UrQMD:
/zfs/store7.hydra.local/gnigmat/mcDst/urqmd
The directory contains README with a brief explanation on datasets there.

vHLLE+UrQMD: 
/zfs/store7.hydra.local/pbatyuk/mcDst/vHLLE_UrQMD/AuAu
Each directory has an internal structure like 07.7GeV-00.0_03.3fm/hydro-XPT/
Going inside one can see files like AuAu_ecm7.7GeV_hydroON_EoSXPT_0.0-3.3fm_1000ev_644.Hydro.mcDst.root 
and AuAu_ecm7.7GeV_hydroON_EoSXPT_0.0-3.3fm_1000ev_644.HydroCascade.mcDst.root
Hydro and HydroCascade are used to dub two types of input, e.g. after hydroevaolution and cascade, respectively.
All the datasets are produced from the original ones put in the /zfs/store6.hydra.local/mpddata/data/models/vHLLE_UrQMD/AuAu directory at the HYBRILIT / GOVORUN supercomputer.

4. Macroses to be used for work
The macro/physical_analysis/femto contains two macroses to be used as a "pattern" to start work with the package.
A very base example is hbtMcDst.C

It demonstrates how to activate a McDst-format reader, initialize a femto analysis, a manager related to the analysis and other technical things to be done for succerssful 
subsequent execution. 
Shown also how to define three types of cuts (event, track and pair) and apply them to the analysis.
Important point: when working with mcDst where no impact parameter written, do not forget to redefine limit ranges of impact parameter in order to avoid event skip by deault.
It can be done as follows:   
// A very important point when working with mcDst input got from vHLLE+UrQMD with no impact parameter written to the tree (-1 by default)
eventCut->setImpactParameter(-1.1, -0.9);

The macro performs two types of analysis (1D and 3D). A brief remark on parameters to be passed to the user constructors and their ordering is also done in the macro.
// Create 1D correlation function integrated over kT
/// Ordered list of parameters to be passed to the constructor ...
/// \param title  Name of the histogram
/// \param nBins  Number of bins
/// \param  qInvLow   Minimum value of the qInv
/// \param  qInvHi    Minimum value of the qInv

// Create 3D correlation function integrated with kT binning 
/// Ordered list of parameters to be passed to the constructor ... 
/// \param title  Name of the histogram
/// \param nBins  Number of bins (will be used for out, side and long projections)
/// \param qLo    Minimum value of the q
/// \param qHi    Maximum value of the q
/// \param ktBins Number of kT bins used in the analysis
/// \param ktLo   Minimum value of kT
/// \param ktHi   Maximum value of kT

As a result, weighted 1D and 3D correlation functions are written to the output ROOT tree with histograms.

The second macro in the directory hbtMcDstAdvanced.C looks similar to those one we have already discussed. It allows one to extend analysis selecting different multiplicity 
bins previously defined. Also a formalism how to work with the cut types available is demonstrated in a deeper manner.
