This list of files is used in the e-by-e fluctuations analysis (strongly intensive observables).

`miniDstProcExample.C` is an adaptation of the original code of the same name. It is used to extract tree with the list of needed observables from the mpdroot files of the miniDst format.

`readTree.C` is the script that allows us to analyze the extracted tree and get the numerical values of the fluctuations observables.

`readSmash.C` is the script that is analogous to readTree.C but it works directly with the Smash root output.
