## Intro
Precise determination of the moments of multiplicity distributions of identified particles could be challenging due to the misidentification in detectors. The so-called Identity Method [1-3] allows one to solve this problem. Using the code placed in this folder, performance of the Identity Method was tested on the Aâ€“A events simulated in the conditions of the MPD experiment at NICA (using TPC dE/dx vs mometum histograms). Namely, moments within a single kinematic window as well as coefficients of forward-backward pseudorapidity correlations are extracted.

The analysis consists of several steps. Note that at each step one needs to properly set paths, filenames, and other parameters inside the scripts.

## 1. Analysis of MPD simulated data
As the first step, trees with event- and track-level information are extracted from the DST root-files (that contain MC and reconstructed data)
using the task `get_tree_MPD_task.cc` from the folder `analysis_task`.
For that, DST files from a chosen directory (e.g. on NICA cluster) are merged into a chain (file names are taken from `inputFilesByHand.txt`).
Execution of the analysis can be started using the `bashRunJobs.sh` script.

## 2. Extraction of the special tree with tracks for identity method
Obtained trees can be then processed using a script `get_info_and_identity_tree.cxx` in the `analysis_of_output_tree` folder.
The script does several things:
1) it extracts a special tree with tracks for Identity Method (called "treeIM") - to be used below,
2) it also performs calculations for Forward-Backward correlations analysis at SIM, REC_PRIMARY and REC_ALL levels,
3) a lot of supplementary information is extracted as well.

## 3. Calculation of "true" moments, extraction of dE/dx distributions
After that, the script `get_dEdx_vs_mom_and_true_pi_K_p_moments_from_tree.C` runs over obtained `an_results.root` file in order to:
1) extract the dEdx vs pTPC distributions and put them in `file_dEdx_in_bins.root` (**IMPORTANT**: this is done with utilizing the PID info from simulations! With real data, this is not possible to do, and sophisticated fits of dE/dx distributions in narrow momentum slices will be required.)
2) calculate the true (i.e. primary-particle level) moments (first, second, cross-moments) and put them in `file_truth_moments_IM.root`.

<a name="sec4"></a>
## 4. Analysis with Identity Method
In the identity_analysis folder, the script `fit_dEdx_pt_slices.C` takes the `file_dEdx_in_bins.root` file and fit narrow momentum slices for each particle species with a function (i.e. Gaus). 
The results for all slices are then stored into `fitted_dEdx_in_pt_bins.root`.

Now everything is ready to run the analysis of the moments with the Identity Method itself. The main script is `analyse_identity_dEdx.C`, which requires the `fitted_dEdx_in_pt_bins.root` and `file_dEdx_in_bins.root` files,
as well as the root-file `an_results.root` with the identity tree "treeIM" (which has a structure shown in the cartoon `structure_tree_for_Identity_Method_analysis_cartoon.png`).
This code is based on the Identity module created by A. Rustamov and M. Arslandok, NIM A 946 (2019) 162622, https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06370, and also a more advanced script provided by A.Rustamov.
In order to load necessary libraries from the identity_analysis/src directory, the analysis should be started via the `run.C` script.
The main output is a `file_extracted_moments_IM.root` file.

## 5. Plotting final results
Finally, truth moments from `file_truth_moments_IM.root` can be compared with those reconstructed with the Identity Method (`file_extracted_moments_IM.root`) by running a script `draw_comparison_truth_IM.C` in the `draw_output` folder.

A set of results obtained with this code can be found in Altsybeev, Petrov, J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 1690 012124 (2020), https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08742.
